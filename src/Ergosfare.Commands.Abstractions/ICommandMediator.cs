///     Represents the mediator interface for sending commands within the application.

/// <remarks>
///     The command mediator is responsible for routing commands to their appropriate handlers
///     and orchestrating the command handling pipeline. It ensures that commands are processed
///     by exactly one handler and provides methods for sending commands both with and without
///     expected results.
///     In the CQRS pattern, commands represent intentions to change the system state. The command
///     mediator helps maintain separation between the command issuers and the command handlers.
