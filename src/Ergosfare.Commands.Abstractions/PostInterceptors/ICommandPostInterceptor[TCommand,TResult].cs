/// <remarks>
/// This interceptor executes after the command has been handled, allowing inspection or modification of the produced <typeparamref name="TResult"/>.
/// 
/// This is a non-type-safe version, meaning that the pipeline internally works with <see cref="object"/>. 
/// If you want full type safety for result modification, use the type-safe version:
/// <see cref="ICommandPostInterceptor{TCommand,TResult,TModifiedResult}"/>.

/// Use this interface when you want to modify the command result without enforcing compile-time type guarantees.
