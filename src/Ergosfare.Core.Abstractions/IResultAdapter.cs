/// <summary>
/// Defines a contract for adapting and inspecting result objects of arbitrary types
/// to extract exceptions without throwing them directly.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The primary purpose of a result adapter is to enable the framework to invoke
/// exception interceptors based on exceptions contained within result objects, 
/// without having to throw these exceptions. This allows the message handling 
/// pipeline to process results and exceptions consistently, regardless of whether
/// the exception occurred naturally or is wrapped inside a result type.
///
/// Implementations of this interface allow the pipeline to remain agnostic to the
/// specific result type returned by handlers, supporting result wrapper types 
/// such as <c>FluentResult</c>, <c>OneOf</c>, or any custom domain-specific result object.
/// 
/// Multiple adapters can be registered in an <see cref="IResultAdapterService"/>, and
/// each adapter is evaluated in order until one indicates it can adapt the result
/// and successfully extracts an exception.
/// </remarks>
