///     Message mediation strategies encapsulate the logic for processing messages through the handling pipeline.
///     Different strategies can implement different patterns such as single handler execution, broadcast to multiple

///     or more complex orchestration of handlers. The strategy determines how pre-handlers, main handlers, post-handlers,
///     and error handlers are invoked during the mediation process.
