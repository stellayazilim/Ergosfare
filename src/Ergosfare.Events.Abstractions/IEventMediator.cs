///     Represents the mediator interface for publishing events within the application.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     The event mediator is responsible for broadcasting events to all registered handlers
///     and orchestrating the event handling pipeline. Unlike commands, which are handled by
///     exactly one handler, events can be handled by multiple handlers, allowing for decoupled
///     communication between different parts of the application.
///     In the publish-subscribe pattern, events represent notifications about something that
///     has happened in the system. The event mediator helps maintain separation between the
///     event publishers and the event subscribers (handlers).
