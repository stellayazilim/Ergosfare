# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We pledge to act with respect and consideration for all people, regardless of experience level, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or other personal characteristics.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

### Unacceptable Behavior (Explicit)
Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form, including hidden or subtle harassment (microaggressions), teasing, or sarcastic remarks that may belittle someone.
- Actions or words that could reasonably be interpreted as offensive or threatening by another participant, even if the intent was not malicious.
- Directing language or gestures toward someone in a way that could be perceived as aggressive or hostile.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without permission.
- Any conduct that undermines the welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment of the project.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [security@ergosfare.com](mailto:security@ergosfare.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement and Reporting
We expect all community members to follow this code of conduct in all project spaces. Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban from the community, at the discretion of project maintainers.

To report a violation, please contact the maintainers at [security@ergosfare.com](mailto:security@ergosfare.com) or open an issue in the official Ergosfare GitHub repository: [stellayazilim/Ergosfare](https://github.com/stellayazilim/Ergosfare).
