# Ergosfare Security Policy

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the security standards for the Ergosfare platform, aiming to protect data, maintain system integrity, and guide responsible reporting of vulnerabilities.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to:
- Ergosfare software and services
- Employees, contractors, and contributors
- Third-party integrations and plugins

## 3. Supported Versions
Security fixes are actively maintained **only for the latest release** of Ergosfare until the first stable version is released.  
Users of older versions are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release to receive security updates.

## 4. Responsible Disclosure
If you discover a security vulnerability:
- **Do not exploit it.**
- Report it immediately via **a.cetinbas@icloud.com** or by opening a **private issue** in the Ergosfare GitHub repository.
- Provide detailed steps, potential impact, and any relevant proof-of-concept.
- Ergosfare will respond promptly and coordinate remediation efforts.

## 5. Reporting Guidelines
When reporting a security issue, include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshots or logs if possible
- Avoid public disclosure until the issue is resolved

## 6. Contact
- **Email:** a.cetinbas@icloud.com
- **GitHub:** Private issues in the Ergosfare repository

## 7. Acknowledgment
Ergosfare may acknowledge contributors who responsibly report security vulnerabilities, with consent.

## 8. Security Best Practices
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Avoid storing sensitive data (passwords, tokens) in plaintext
- Use safe defaults for authentication, access control, and configuration
- Follow [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices/) where applicable
- **Third-party / n-party plugins:** Only use plugins verified by the Ergosfare team. Unverified n-party plugins may introduce security risks and are the responsibility of the user to assess

## 9. Updates to Security Policy
This policy may be updated periodically. Users are encouraged to review the latest version.
